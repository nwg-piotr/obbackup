# obbackup

A simple tool to backup and restore Openbox config files in several clicks, written in Python GTK+3.

The script was designed for my personal use, so the selection of files to archive may not fit everyone.
If you find it useful anyway, feel free to build, or just download and install the .tar.xz package (Arch Linux).
You'll find it in the `dist` folder, together with the PKGBUILD file.
